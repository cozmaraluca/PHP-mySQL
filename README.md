# PHP-mySQL
  For this project I am working with MySQL using SQL and Adobe Dreamweaver using PHP, HTML and CSS. 
  I have created two tables, one stores the children , while the other stores the parents. Each child has the parent they belong to. The two tables are connected through the parent's id.
  My goal was being able to add new entries, edit some of the data and display the parents along with their children (if they have one) and the parent's profession.
